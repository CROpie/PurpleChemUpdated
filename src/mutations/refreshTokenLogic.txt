refresh token logic

when navigating between pages, if a token expires it will be automatically refreshed
(Thanks to using useLocation with useEffect in PrivateRoot which is the parent of all private routes)

but: if a page is left open, it will expire and not refresh. This is solved by:

const JWT = await getSessionWithRefresh():
    gets a token from the session cookie if available
    uses a refresh token to generate a new token if session has expired
    toasts error "session has expired" and return nothing if refresh token has also expired
