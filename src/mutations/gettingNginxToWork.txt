Nginx: 433 -> 81 (auth) and 80 (data) APIs

Changed exposed port (Uvicorn) on apis to 433 (not sure if this was necessary)

Opened docker with 81:433 and 80:433

((could have stuck with 433 -> 81 -> 81 ? ))

Anyway, even with the changes, nginx was causing problems.
The auth API was working fine, but the data one wasn't

4 network responses:

OPTIONS (preflight) 202
GET (Which had Auth on the request headers)
OPTIONS (preflight) 
GET (403 Not Authorized)

Thought the problem was something to do with Auth, but in the end it wasn't

When nginx reroutes from https to http on the droplet, it adds a / to the URL

api2.cropie.store/inventory
->
api2.cropie.store/inventory/

So added a slash to the end of the api calls to be consistent with nginx, and suddenly it's working fine.

Not sure why auth was working without this slash though ???

A trailing slash is being added by nginx, which is caused all my problems

Had to add trailing slashes before /? in query parameters too.
